The ndarray supports records intrinsically.  None of the default
descriptors have fields defined, but you can create new descriptors
easily.  The ndarray even supports nested arrays of records inside of
a record.  Any record that the array protocol can describe can be
represented.  The ndarray also supports partial field descriptors.
